That's a smart approach! Qualifying leads early helps you pitch the right solution immediately.

Here is a structured, five-step survey designed for your landing page. It starts broad to assess their plantation reality, then narrows down to determine if they are ready for the basic Comprehensive Monitoring (mapping/health) or the advanced AI Drone (Trossen Counting/Yield Forecasting).

Plantation Readiness Survey: Choosing Your Digital Solution
This short survey helps us understand your operation so we can recommend the perfect service package (Comprehensive Monitoring or AI Yield Forecasting).

1. Operation Scale & Immediate Goal
A. What is the total size of the estate you wish to survey?

□ Less than 500 Hectares

□ 500 – 2,000 Hectares

□ More than 2,000 Hectares

B. What is your primary challenge or immediate goal? (Select one)

□ Gaining accurate, up-to-date plantation maps and tree health data.

□ Improving the precision of my Fresh Fruit Bunch (FFB) yield forecasts (trossen counting).

□ Detecting early signs of pest, disease, and nutrient deficiencies.

2. Current Pain Point (Trossen Counting Focus)
C. How confident are you in the accuracy of your current method for forecasting FFB yield (bunch counting)?

□ Very confident (We use modern methods and data is highly reliable).

□ Moderately confident (We use manual census, but results are often inconsistent).

□ Low confidence (Manual census is slow, expensive, and we routinely miss 10%+ of potential yield).

3. Service Requirement Assessment
D. Which of the following data points is the most critical for your next decision-making cycle? (Select one)

□ Detailed spatial data: Weed detection, stand density, and high-resolution mapping. (Focuses on Comprehensive Monitoring)

□ Real-time yield data: Validated, tree-by-tree bunch and flower counts for harvesting and budget planning. (Focuses on AI Drone / Trossen Counting)

4. Technical Environment
E. Are your estates primarily composed of dense, mature palm stands (over 7 years old)?

□ Yes, the majority is dense/mature.

□ No, we have a mix of young and mature stands.

Recommended Service Logic (Internal Guide)
Client Selection Profile	Recommended Package
D = "Real-time yield data" AND C = "Low confidence"	AI Drone Trossen Counting
D = "Real-time yield data" AND E = "Yes"	AI Drone Trossen Counting
D = "Detailed spatial data" OR B = "Gaining accurate maps"	Comprehensive Monitoring
Any other combination	Start with Comprehensive Monitoring (and consult on AI upgrade path)
